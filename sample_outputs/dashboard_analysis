# UI Demonstration – LogSense Dashboard

This section presents the primary visualizations generated by the log analysis system.  
All charts dynamically reflect time-window filtering, template aggregation, and structured JSON output integration.

## 1. Process-Level Analysis

![Process Analysis](../../Images/process-analysis.png)

This view provides a ranked breakdown of active processes (PID) based on log frequency within the selected time window.

Processes are categorized into:

- High Activity (>20%)
- Medium Activity (10–20%)
- Normal Activity (<10%)

Key capabilities:

- Identifies logging-heavy components
- Highlights potential performance impact
- Enables drill-down into thread-level inspection
- Supports export functionality for reporting

This allows rapid identification of dominant processes contributing to system log volume.

## 2. Thread-Level Breakdown

![Thread Breakdown](../../Images/thread-breakdown.png)

This screen provides thread-level (TID) distribution within a selected process.

It enables detailed inspection of execution paths responsible for excessive logging.

Displayed information includes:

- Log frequency per thread
- Percentage contribution to parent PID
- Ranked thread table
- Recommendation classification

This supports fine-grained root-cause analysis at execution-unit level.

## 3. Top Log Templates

![Top Templates](../../Images/top-templates.png)

This section displays the most frequent normalized log templates extracted through pattern mining.

Each template includes:

- Frequency
- Percentage contribution
- Impact classification (HIGH / MEDIUM / NORMAL)
- Example PID association
- Priority level

This view enables:

- Identification of high-impact recurring patterns
- Detection of abnormal log concentration
- Prioritization for debugging or optimization

---

## System Architecture Context

All visualizations are generated from structured JSON outputs produced by the log mining engine.

The backend performs:

- Timestamp parsing
- Template normalization
- Frequency aggregation
- Time-window filtering
- Baseline vs current window comparison
- Drift and spike detection logic

The UI consumes this structured output and renders interactive dashboards with drill-down capability.
