### Process-Level Analysis

![Process Analysis](Images/process-analysis.png)

This view provides a ranked breakdown of active processes (PID) based on log frequency within the selected time window.  

Processes are categorized into:
- High Activity (>20%)
- Medium Activity (10–20%)
- Normal Activity (<10%)

This enables quick identification of logging-heavy components that may impact system performance.  
Users can drill down into a selected process to inspect thread-level behavior.

### Thread-Level Breakdown

![Thread Breakdown](Images/thread-breakdown.png)

This screen shows thread-level (TID) distribution within a selected process.  

It highlights dominant threads responsible for excessive logging and provides:
- Log frequency per thread
- Percentage contribution to parent PID
- Ranked thread view with recommendations

This supports fine-grained root-cause analysis at execution path level.

### Top Log Templates

![Top Templates](Images/top-templates.png)

This section displays the most frequent normalized log templates extracted after pattern mining.

Each template includes:
- Frequency
- Percentage contribution
- Impact classification (HIGH / MEDIUM / NORMAL)
- Example PID association

This view helps identify high-impact recurring log patterns and supports prioritization for optimization or debugging.
